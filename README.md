# Camera-Objects

Testing out UX for mutiple 3D obejcts that can be interacted with a scene in Swift. 

The objects are collada files referenced in a SceneKit scene file (.SCN). Note: the project has been built & tested using XCode 8 (it may still work with XCode 7).

There are 2 models in the scene.  The camera starts out in a position away & above the models.  The camera is moved to the centre of the scene using SCNActions.

Swiping left or right will rotate the camera to face one of the objects.

The origami crane model is made by JuanG.  The usage terms for the model are creative commons.
